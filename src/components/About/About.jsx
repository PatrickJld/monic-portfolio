                    Hello, my name is Monica Aprilia Budiarti. Most known as Monic. I'm an Illustration major student
                    with
                    over five years experience freelancer. I've successfully managed marketing in exhibition, usherette,
                    dancer, content creator, and mostly as talent. I'm eager to bring my skills to a dynamic team and
                    help drive the organization's growth.
